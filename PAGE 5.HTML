    Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.  <br> Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.
    Asset allocation and diversification strategies do not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. <br>
    Hypothetical returns do not reflect trading costs, transaction fees, commissions, <br> or actual taxes due on investment returns.
    The results are based on information from a variety of sources we consider reliable, <br> but we do not represent that the information is accurate or complete.

<p>  <img src="Nouveau dossier/images (11).jpg" alt="">  <br>
    Portfolio model information represents a blended portfolio consisting of the model's underlying positions and assigned weights provided by the user and rebalanced at the specified schedule.
   <br> The results were constructed using net of fee mutual fund performance. Portfolio Visualizer does not provide preferential treatment to any specific security or investment.
    The results are based on the total return of assets and assume that all received dividends and distributions are reinvested.
    Compound annualized growth rate (CAGR) is the annualized geometric mean return of the portfolio. <br> It is calculated from the portfolio start and end balance and is thus impacted by any cashflows.
    The time-weighted rate of return (TWRR) is a measure of the compound rate of growth in a portfolio. This is
     calculated from the holding period returns (e.g. monthly returns), and TWRR will thus not be impacted by cashflows. If there are no external cashflows, TWRR will equal CAGR.</p>

     <p> <img src="Nouveau dossier/images (12).jpg" alt=""> <br>
        Tracking error, also known as active risk, is the standard deviation of active return. <br> This is displayed as annualized value based on the standard deviation <br> of monthly active returns.
        Information ratio is the active return divided by the tracking error. <br> It measures whether the investment outperformed its benchmark consistently.
        Gain/Loss ratio is a measure of downside risk, and it is calculated as the average positive return in up periods divided by the average negative return in down periods.
        Upside Capture Ratio measures how well the fund performed relative to the benchmark <br> when the market was up, and Downside Capture Ratio measures <br>
         how well the fund performed relative to the benchmark when the market was down. <br> An upside capture ratio greater than 100 would indicate <br>
         that the fund outperformed its benchmark when the market was up, and a downside capture ratio below</p>
